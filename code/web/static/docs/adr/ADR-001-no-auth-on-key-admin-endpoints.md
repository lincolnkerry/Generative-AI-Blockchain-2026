# ADR-001: No Authentication on Key and Admin Endpoints

## Date

2026-06-16

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Privacy Router HTTP API is primarily intended to run on the operator's local workstation or inside a trusted local network during development, demo, and small-scale deployments. The project currently has a single authentication primitive: API keys (`server/api/auth.py`) that are verified via a `Bearer` token and a SHA-256 hash stored in the `ApiKey` table. This primitive is used to protect LLM-facing routes such as `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/responses`, `/api/v1/classify`, and `/api/v1/generate`.

However, several management endpoints in `server/api/routes/keys.py` and `server/api/routes/proxy.py` do **not** call `Depends(require_auth)`:

- `GET /api/v1/keys`
- `POST /api/v1/keys`
- `POST /api/v1/keys/{key_id}/renew`
- `PATCH /api/v1/keys/{key_id}`
- `DELETE /api/v1/keys/{key_id}`
- `GET /api/settings`
- `POST /api/settings`

There is also a bootstrapping problem: the only way to create the first API key is through the key-management endpoint, but the key-management endpoint itself currently requires no credentials. Requiring authentication for these endpoints would force the project to add a separate admin account system (passwords, sessions, or OAuth) and increase operational complexity for users who just want to run the server locally.

## Decision

Leave the key-management and admin/settings endpoints unauthenticated for the current release.

Rationale:

1. **Local-only/trusted-network deployment model**: The server is not exposed to the public internet in the recommended deployment model. Authentication is therefore treated as a network-layer concern rather than an application-layer requirement for management endpoints.
2. **Avoid account-management cost**: Adding an admin user model, password hashing, session handling, or SSO integration would materially increase code size, test surface, and user onboarding friction.
3. **Bootstrap simplicity**: A new installation must be configurable without first possessing a valid API key. Keeping key creation open solves the chicken-and-egg problem.
4. **Consistent with current admin UI**: `web/admin.html` performs key, provider, and settings operations with plain `fetch()` calls that carry no authorization header. Adding auth to the backend would require a matching frontend authentication flow.

## Consequences

Positive:

- Zero-config onboarding: users can start the server and create the first API key immediately.
- The standalone admin UI works without a login page or session handling.
- Lower maintenance burden: no password reset, account lockout, or session expiry logic.

Negative:

- Any process or user that can reach the management port can list, create, renew, revoke, or delete API keys and change runtime settings.
- A leaked admin URL or accidental public binding of the server exposes the entire key store and configuration.
- Audit logging of administrative actions cannot be attributed to a specific authenticated principal.

## Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Unauthorized key creation/revocation by anyone with network access to the admin port | High in shared networks | High | Run the server bound to `127.0.0.1` only; use a reverse proxy with mTLS or VPN for remote access. |
| Accidental exposure when a user binds the server to `0.0.0.0` on a public interface | Medium | High | Document the security model clearly in README and startup logs; add an explicit `--host` warning in startup scripts. |
| Key material exfiltration through `GET /api/v1/keys` (note: the raw key value is not returned by this endpoint, but metadata such as prefix, status, and usage timestamps is) | Medium | Medium | Avoid exposing the admin port to untrusted clients. |
| Inability to meet compliance/audit requirements that demand authenticated administrative actions | Medium | Medium | Treat this architecture as a development/demo tier; production hardening must add an authentication layer before exposing the API. |
